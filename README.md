2015 Flight Delays and Cancellation
# Introduction
Flight disruptions, including cancellations and 
diversions, significantly affect airline operations and 
passenger experiences. This analysis examines these 
disruptions by exploring cancellation reasons and 
patterns across airlines and airports. Using data 
cleaned with Python, the goal is to provide insights 
that can help improve operational efficiency and 
reduce the impact of disruptions on travelers.
